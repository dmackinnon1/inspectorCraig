# inspectorCraig
Generator for logic puzzles in the style of "The Case Files of Inspector Craig," from "What is the Name of this Book" by Raymond M. Smullyan.

## Generating the Puzzle Data

This project will generate a set of logic problems based on some of the problems found in chapter 6 of "What is the Name of this Book" by Raymond M. Smullyan.
In these problems, readers are invited to solve a crime based on a list of suspects and a set of clues about who is involved in the crime. The suspects may ultimately be guilty, innocent, or have undetermined guilt or innocence based on the evidence provided.

The puzzles are generated and saved in **.json** files in the **data** directory. These are generated by a Java program that is built and executed by running the **build.sh** script.
